In fact, this bug has been known to sway to and fro as it walks...just so it looks like a leaf blown by the wind! And the fakery works! These insects look so much like leaves that even leaf-eating insects nibble on them! Lying liars, indeed!"

I say, did you know that walking sticks can grow to two feet long?! Imagine running into one! Surely I would faint."

Aggressive predators with venomous stingers, wasps not only hunt and eat other insects... they paralyze their prey, then drag their victims home ALIVE, leaving them for their larva to feed upon. Suddenly a simple sting seems quite tolerable."

A recipe for disaster, I say. Just imagine reaching for a four-leaf clover, only to touch a larva instead! Yuck! The worst of luck!"
